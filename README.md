# penrose-tiles

Currently the [app](http://dkokic.github.io/penrose-tiles) draws a [pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon) and starts splitting it according to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th3YMEamzmw).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and greatly inspired by this [SVG project](https://github.com/sgwilym/relay-visual-learners).
